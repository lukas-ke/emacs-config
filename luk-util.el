STATES is a list of symbols that correspond to other
save-functions, and can be one or more of the following:

  excursion: `save-excursion'
  match-data: `save-match-data'
  org-outline-visibility: `org-save-outline-visibility'
  window-excursion: `save-window-excursion'

The benefit is that this reduces the nesting in situations where
several of these functions are needed.

Example:
    ;; Position and match-data will be restored on exit
    (luk-save (excursion match-data)
      (goto-char (point-min))
      (re-search-forward \"foo\"))

The above example expands to:
    (save-excursion
      (save-match-data
        (goto-char (point-min)
        (re-search-forward \"foo\"))))"

  ;; other function I wrote had a lot of these save-forms. It might be
  ;; super inefficient or just wrong in other ways.

  ;; Indent only one step on second line (like the example)
  ;; insted of all the way up to the STATES-list.
